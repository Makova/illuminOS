## Quick Install

Clone the git repository in any local directory by typing the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/idimitrakopoulos/illuminOS
$ cd illuminOS
```
Now you need to upload it to your microcontroller. To do this you can either use the excellent `mpfshell` [see installation instructions here](https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell).

After installing mpfshell you should connect your PC and microntroller via USB and type:

```bash
$ sudo mpfshell -s mpf_cmd.mpf
```
